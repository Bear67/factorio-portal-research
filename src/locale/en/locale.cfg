portal-research=Enables you to start working with the unusual local substance Factorium and ultimately leverage its bizarre teleportation properties.
short-range-teleportation=Unlocks the secret of using portals to teleport items from one location to another within limited distance.
large-mass-teleportation=Enables the construction of larger portals which bigger masses such as people and vehicles can pass through.
interplanetary-teleportation=Allows teleportation as far as other bodies within the local system. Portals must be physically deployed to such bodies by launching a portal lander. Additionally upgrades all your portals to transfer matter over longer distances, at reduced power cost.
astronomy=The science of observing the universe around us, allows you to begin studying the stars and local system.
