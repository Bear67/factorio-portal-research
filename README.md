== Space & Portals

Factorio mod by Doc

This mod adds a variety of mid- and late-game technologies and extends the end-game with new research into space exploration and portals. Entirely new mechanics, logistical and design challenges await as you expand your orbital network to plunder resources from asteroids ... and perhaps ultimately acquire the ability to send a distress message home!

Major features:

 * Portals
   - Portal Chests teleport items from one chest to another (at great power cost)
   - Portal Belts have greater reach than normal underground belts and are near-instantaneous to solve tricky factory routing problems, but they also consume energy
   - Portal Gates allow the player (and vehicles) to travel quickly around the base, and also to exotic off-world destinations!

 * Space exploration
   - Portal Lander (launched in a rocket) deploys a portal gate onto a remote body so you can travel there
   - Observatories scan for nearby bodies (currently only asteroids of various sizes) and give estimates of resources found there
   - Space Telescopes must be launched in a rocket but can spot much more distant (and potentially much more interesting!) objects, as well as providing more accurate resource estimates

 * Production / logistics / energy management
   - Microwave Power Transmission lets you transfer power over long distances

TODO:

   - Orbital Cargo Drop Containers, an efficient way to deliver resources from off-world
   - Orbital Mining Lasers enable extremely fast resource extraction
   - Personal Microwave Antenna lets you power your suit remotely from the grid
   - Space Based Solar Power provides a much easier mechanism to power your off-world factories utilising remote energy collection
   - Portal defense equipment ... rips stuff up automaticallly with portals
   - Portal weapon / factorium ammo
   - Oh and a couple of turrets
   - Mainframe
